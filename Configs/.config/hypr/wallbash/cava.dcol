# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
; autosens = 1

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa', 'fifo', 'sndio' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'pipewire', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
# On windows this is automatic and no input settings are needed.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio and pipewire 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For piepwire 'source' will be the object name or object.serial of the device to capture from.
# Both input and output devices are supported.
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
# For shmem 'source' will be /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF where 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' will be squeezelite's MAC address

[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses', 'raw', 'noritake', 'sdl'
# or 'sdl_glsl'.
# 'noncurses' uses a custom framebuffer technique and prints only changes
# from frame to frame in the terminal. 'ncurses' is default if supported.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
#
# 'noritake' outputs a bitmap in the format expected by a Noritake VFD display
#  in graphic mode. It only support the 3000 series graphical VFDs for now.
#
# 'sdl' uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer to render in a graphical context.
# 'sdl_glsl' uses SDL to create an OpenGL context. Write your own shaders or
# use one of the predefined ones.
; method = ncurses

# Orientation of the visualization. Can be 'bottom', 'top', 'left' or 'right'.
# Default is 'bottom'. Other orientations are only supported on sdl and ncruses
# output. Note: many fonts have weird glyphs for 'top' and 'right' characters,
# which can make ncurses not look right.
; orientation = bottom

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
# set 'reverse' to 1 to display frequencies the other way around.

# Only supported on ncurses and noncurses output.
